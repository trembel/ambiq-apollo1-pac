> Peripheral access API for the Ambiq Apollo 1 microcontrollers

This repo contains the sources used to generate the code for the Ambiq Apollo 1
microcontroller from the corresponding SVD files, which can be found on https://ambiqmicro.com/mcu/ in the SDK (Not included in this repo due to copyright).

We use `svd2rust` to generate the code, `form` to organize it, and `cargo fmt`
to make it pretty.
